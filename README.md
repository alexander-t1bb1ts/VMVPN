<h1>Virtual Machine + VPN</h1>
This tutorial is a brief walk-through for installing a VPN (Virtual Private Network) on a VM (Virtual Machine)<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- ProtonVPN (Free Version)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Off-screen step:</h2>

- It's probably advantageous to go ahead and create your protonvpn account on your actual computer before you actually install it on your virtual machine. For all intents and purposes, this tutorial begins after the creation of the ProtonVPN "Free" account, which you can create <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">here</a>. 

<h2>Walkthough</h2>

First thing's first, we'll go ahead and create our virtual machine in Azure. For this demonstration, we're using Windows 10. Then, we're going to go ahead and connect to it in Remote Desktop.

Obviously, its IP address is how we establish that connection, but just to verify for educational purposes, I've done a quick "What's my IP address?" search, and it's yielded the exact number we would have suspected the IP address to be. 172.174.231.250 out of lovely Washington, Virginia.

<br />

<p>
The next step is to head on over to Protonvpn.com on our VM, and download the version appropriate for its operating system.

</p>
<br />
Then we'll run through our setup Wizard really quick.


<p>
Once the application has installed, you can then enter your credentials previously established with protonvpn, and log right in.

<p>It is limited, being a free service, but of course you do have a few options to explore. For this demonstration, I eventually chose the Japanese server, and then asked bing what my IP address was yet again.

  Success! Clearly, the VPN does its job. So well so, that the default loading browser is in a completely new language without meddling in any additional settings.
